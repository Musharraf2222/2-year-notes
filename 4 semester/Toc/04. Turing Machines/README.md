## 01. Introduction


Turing Machine was invented by Alan Turing in 1936 and it is used to accept Recursive Enumerable Languages (generated by Type-0 Grammar). 

Turing machines are a fundamental concept in the theory of computation and play an important role in the field of computer science. They were first described by the mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1936 and provide a mathematical model of a simple abstract computer.

In the context of automata theory and the theory of computation, Turing machines are used to study the properties of algorithms and to determine what problems can and cannot be solved by computers. They provide a way to model the behavior of algorithms and to analyze their computational complexity, which is the amount of time and memory they require to solve a problem.

A Turing machine is a finite automaton that can read, write, and erase symbols on an infinitely long tape. The tape is divided into squares, and each square contains a symbol. The Turing machine can only read one symbol at a time, and it uses a set of rules (the transition function) to determine its next action based on the current state and the symbol it is reading.

The Turing machine’s behavior is determined by a finite state machine, which consists of a finite set of states, a transition function that defines the actions to be taken based on the current state and the symbol being read, and a set of start and accept states. The Turing machine begins in the start state and performs the actions specified by the transition function until it reaches an accept or reject state. If it reaches an accept state, the computation is considered successful; if it reaches a reject state, the computation is considered unsuccessful.

Turing machines are an important tool for studying the limits of computation and for understanding the foundations of computer science. They provide a simple yet powerful model of computation that has been widely used in research and has had a profound impact on our understanding of algorithms and computation.

A turing machine consists of a tape of infinite length on which read and writes operation can be performed. The tape consists of infinite cells on which each cell either contains input symbol or a special symbol called blank. It also consists of a head pointer which points to cell currently being read and it can move in both directions.

A TM is expressed as a 7-tuple (Q, T, B, ?, ?, q0, F) where: 
 

- Q is a finite set of states
- T is the tape alphabet (symbols which can be written on Tape)
- B is blank symbol (every cell is filled with B except input alphabet initially)
- ? is the input alphabet (symbols which are part of input alphabet)
- ? is a transition function which maps Q × T ? Q × T × {L,R}. Depending on its present state and present tape alphabet (pointed by head pointer), it will move to new state, change the tape symbol (may or may not) and move head pointer to either left or right.
- q0 is the initial state
- F is the set of final states. If any state of F is reached, input string is accepted.

Let us construct a turing machine for L={0^n1^n|n>=1} 
 

- Q = {q0,q1,q2,q3} where q0 is initial state.
- T = {0,1,X,Y,B} where B represents blank.
- ? = {0,1}
- F = {q3}
Transition function ? is given in Table 1 as:

# Definition of Turing Machine (TM) as Language Acceptors and Transducers

## Definition of Turing Machine (TM)

### Overview of Turing Machines

A Turing Machine (TM) is a theoretical computational model introduced by Alan Turing in 1936. It is used to formalize the concept of computation and to understand the limits of what can be computed. A Turing Machine manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a set of rules.

### Components of a Turing Machine

- **Tape**: An infinitely long strip divided into cells, each containing a symbol from a finite alphabet.
- **Head**: A read/write head that scans the tape, capable of reading and writing symbols and moving left or right.
- **State Register**: Stores the current state of the Turing Machine, which is one of a finite number of states.
- **Transition Function**: A set of rules that determines the machine's actions based on the current state and the symbol being read.

### Types of Turing Machines

- **Deterministic Turing Machine (DTM)**: Each state and symbol pair has exactly one action.
- **Non-Deterministic Turing Machine (NDTM)**: Each state and symbol pair can have multiple possible actions.

## Turing Machines as Language Acceptors

 

### Language Acceptance

A Turing Machine acts as a language acceptor by accepting or rejecting strings of symbols based on the transition function.

#### Recognizable Languages

A language \( L \) is recognizable by a Turing Machine if there exists a Turing Machine \( M \) such that for any string \( w \) in \( L \), \( M \) enters the accept state.

 
### Examples of Turing Machines as Language Acceptors

- **Palindrome Recognition**: A Turing Machine can be designed to accept strings that are palindromes.
- **Binary Addition Verification**: A Turing Machine can be designed to accept strings representing valid sums of binary numbers.

## Turing Machines as Transducers

### Formal Definition

A Turing Machine can act as a transducer by transforming input strings into output strings. This is often represented by having multiple tapes (input and output tapes).

### Transduction Process

#### Input and Output Tapes

A Turing Machine with an input tape and an output tape can read from the input tape and write to the output tape, performing a transformation.

 

### Examples of Turing Machines as Transducers

- **Binary to Decimal Conversion**: A Turing Machine can convert a binary number on the input tape to its decimal equivalent on the output tape.
- **String Reversal**: A Turing Machine can reverse a string from the input tape and write the reversed string on the output tape.

## Comparative Analysis

### Differences between Acceptors and Transducers

- **Acceptors**: Turing Machines that determine membership in a language by accepting or rejecting strings.
- **Transducers**: Turing Machines that transform input strings into output strings.

### Applications and Use Cases

- **Language Acceptors**: Used in formal language theory, compiler design, and language recognition.
- **Transducers**: Used in data processing, function computation, and various transformations.

## Historical Context and Significance

### Development of the Turing Machine Concept

Alan Turing introduced the concept of the Turing Machine in his 1936 paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem." This work laid the foundation for theoretical computer science.

### Impact on Computer Science and Computation Theory

Turing Machines have profoundly influenced the development of algorithms, complexity theory, and the understanding of the limits of computation. They remain a fundamental concept in computer science education and research.
