According to the Chomsky hierarchy, grammar is divided into 4 types as follows:

1. **Type 0**: Unrestricted Grammar
2. **Type 1**: Context-Sensitive Grammar
3. **Type 2**: Context-Free Grammar
4. **Type 3**: Regular Grammar

## Type 0: Unrestricted Grammar

Type-0 grammars include all formal grammar. Type 0 grammar languages are recognized by Turing machines. These languages are also known as the Recursively Enumerable languages.

Grammar Production in the form of ``a --->p``  \(\alpha \to \beta\) where:
```
 Î± is (V + T)* V (V + T)*
 V : Variables
 T : Terminals
 Î² is ((V + T)*
```

In Type 0, there must be at least one variable on the left side of production.

**For example**:
```
Sab --> ba 
A --> S
```
Here, Variables are \(S, A\), and Terminals \(a, b\).

## Type 1: Context-Sensitive Grammar

Type-1 grammars generate context-sensitive languages. The language generated by the grammar is recognized by the Linear Bounded Automata.

In Type 1:

- First of all, Type 1 grammar should be Type 0.
- Grammar Production in the form of \(\alpha \to \beta\) where \(|\alpha| \le |\beta|\)
  - That is, the count of symbols in \(\alpha\) is less than or equal to \(\beta\).
- \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) belong to \((V + T)^+\)

**For example**:
```
S --> AB
AB --> abc 
B --> b  
```

## Type 2: Context-Free Grammar

Type-2 grammars generate context-free languages. The language generated by the grammar is recognized by a Pushdown Automata.

In Type 2:

- First of all, it should be Type 1.
- The left-hand side of production can have only one variable and there is no restriction on \(\beta\).
- \(|\alpha| = 1\)

**For example**:
```
S --> AB 
A --> a 
B --> b 
```

## Type 3: Regular Grammar

Type-3 grammars generate regular languages. These languages are exactly all languages that can be accepted by a finite-state automaton. Type 3 is the most restricted form of grammar.

Type 3 should be in the given form only:

- \(V --> VT / T\) (left-regular grammar)
  - or
- \(V --> TV /T\) (right-regular grammar)

**For example**:
```
S --> a
```
The above form is called strictly regular grammar.

There is another form of regular grammar called extended regular grammar. In this form:

- \(V --> VT^* / T^*\) (extended left-regular grammar)
  - or
- \(V --> T^*V /T^*\) (extended right-regular grammar)

**For example**:
```
S --> ab
```
