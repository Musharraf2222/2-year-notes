# Finite Automata & Regular Expression

## 1. Basic Machine
A basic machine in the context of automata theory is a mathematical model of computation that performs calculations automatically based on a given set of instructions. It can be represented using states and transitions between those states.

## 2. Finite State Machine (FSM)
A Finite State Machine is a computational model used to design computer programs and sequential logic circuits. It consists of a finite number of states, transitions between those states, and actions. FSMs are categorized into two types: Deterministic (DFA) and Nondeterministic (NDFA).

## 3. Transition Graph
A Transition Graph is a visual representation of a finite automaton. It consists of nodes (states) and directed edges (transitions) that show how the automaton moves from one state to another based on input symbols.

## 4. Transition Matrix
A Transition Matrix is a tabular representation of a finite automaton. Each cell of the matrix specifies the next state for a given current state and input symbol. It provides a convenient way to implement the transition function.

## 5. Deterministic and Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (DFA & NDFA)
- **DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton)**: A DFA has a single unique transition for each symbol in the alphabet from each state. It has exactly one transition path for each input.
- **NDFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton)**: An NDFA can have multiple transitions for the same symbol from a given state. It allows for multiple possible paths for each input symbol, including epsilon (ε) transitions (transitions without consuming any input).

## 6. Equivalence of DFA and NDFA
DFAs and NDFAs are equivalent in terms of the languages they recognize. For every NDFA, there exists an equivalent DFA that recognizes the same language. The conversion process from an NDFA to a DFA is called the subset construction or powerset construction.

## 7. Decision Properties
Decision properties refer to the problems related to finite automata that can be algorithmically solved. Common decision properties include:
- **Emptiness Problem**: Checking if the language recognized by an automaton is empty.
- **Finiteness Problem**: Checking if the language recognized by an automaton is finite.
- **Membership Problem**: Checking if a given string belongs to the language recognized by an automaton.

## 8. Minimization of Finite Automata
Minimization involves reducing the number of states in a finite automaton while preserving the language it recognizes. The goal is to obtain a minimal DFA (DFA with the fewest states). Techniques for minimization include state equivalence and partition refinement methods.

## 9. Mealy & Moore Machines
- **Mealy Machine**: A finite state machine where the output is determined by both the current state and the current input.
- **Moore Machine**: A finite state machine where the output is determined solely by the current state.

## 10. Alphabet, Words, Operations
- **Alphabet**: A finite, non-empty set of symbols (Σ).
- **Words**: Finite sequences of symbols from the alphabet. Also known as strings.
- **Operations**: Operations on words include concatenation, union, intersection, and complementation.

## 11. Regular Sets
Regular sets (or regular languages) are the languages that can be recognized by finite automata. They can be described using regular expressions and can be obtained through operations such as union, concatenation, and Kleene star.

## 12. Relationship and Conversion between Finite Automata and Regular Expressions
Finite automata and regular expressions are two equivalent representations of regular languages. Regular expressions can be converted into finite automata using construction methods such as Thompson's construction, and finite automata can be converted into regular expressions using state elimination techniques.

## 13. Designing Regular Expressions
Designing regular expressions involves creating patterns that describe a set of strings. Regular expressions use operators such as union (|), concatenation, and Kleene star (*) to construct patterns.

## 14. Closure Properties of Regular Sets
Regular sets are closed under various operations, meaning the result of these operations on regular sets is also a regular set. Closure properties include:
- **Union**: The union of two regular sets is a regular set.
- **Intersection**: The intersection of two regular sets is a regular set.
- **Complement**: The complement of a regular set is a regular set.
- **Concatenation**: The concatenation of two regular sets is a regular set.
- **Kleene Star**: The Kleene star of a regular set is a regular set.
