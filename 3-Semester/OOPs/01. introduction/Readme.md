# Object Oriented Programming in C++

## Overview

Object-oriented programming (OOP) uses objects in programming. The main aim of OOP is to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc., in programming. It aims to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

## Key Concepts of OOP

OOP is based on several fundamental concepts, which act as its building blocks:

1. **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or fields), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

    **Example**:

    ```cpp
    class Car {
    public:
        int speed;
        int mileage;

        void applyBrakes() {
            // logic to apply brakes
        }
    };
    ```

2. **Objects**: Instances of classes. Objects hold data and can perform functions defined by their class.

    **Example**:

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    class Person {
        char name[20];
        int id;

    public:
        void getDetails() {
            // logic to get details
        }
    };

    int main() {
        Person p1; // p1 is an object
        return 0;
    }
    ```

3. **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data within one unit, e.g., a class in C++. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.

4. **Abstraction**: The concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.

5. **Polymorphism**: The ability of different objects to respond to the same function call in different ways. It allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions.

6. **Inheritance**: A mechanism by which one class can inherit the properties and methods of another class. It provides a way to create a new class using the properties and methods of an existing class.

7. **Dynamic Binding**: The code to be executed in response to a function call is determined at runtime.

8. **Message Passing**: Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving information to each other. Messages (function calls) are sent to invoke behavior.

## Characteristics of an Object-Oriented Programming Language

OOP languages share several common characteristics, including but not limited to the above key concepts. They facilitate a modular approach to programming and make it easier to manage and modify complex systems.

## OOPS Concepts in C++

In C++, OOP is a paradigm that provides a clear modular structure for programs, making it good for defining abstract data types where implementation details are hidden. It emphasizes the following:

- **Class and Object creation**
- **Data Encapsulation and Abstraction**
- **Inheritance among classes**
- **Polymorphism through function overloading and operator overloading**

These concepts help in creating reusable code and reducing redundancy.

## Differences between Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming

### Procedural Programming

Procedural Programming can be defined as a programming model which is derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of calling procedures. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply consist of a series of computational steps to be carried out. During a programâ€™s execution, any given procedure might be called at any point, including by other procedures or itself.

**Languages used in Procedural Programming**: FORTRAN, ALGOL, COBOL, BASIC, Pascal, and C.

### Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming can be defined as a programming model based upon the concept of objects. Objects contain data in the form of attributes and code in the form of methods. In object-oriented programming, computer programs are designed using the concept of objects that interact with the real world. Object-oriented programming languages are various but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.

**Languages used in Object-Oriented Programming**: Java, C++, C#, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, Objective-C, Dart, Swift, Scala.

## Functional Programming vs Object-Oriented Programming

### Functional Programming

In functional programming, we have to build programs using functions. An example of functional programming is the C language.

### Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming is built by using classes and objects. In this, we have concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and data abstraction.

In the above article, we have covered functional programming and object-oriented programming and the difference between them. Both paradigms have their own advantages and are used according to the needs of the project. Languages like Python and Java support both paradigms, allowing flexibility in programming.

## Conclusion

OOP in C++ facilitates the creation of programs that are more modular, easier to maintain, and more intuitive to understand. By mastering these concepts, developers can build robust and scalable software applications.
